Miscellaneous Bioinformatics Scripts
####################################

This is a set of tools I developed to do some basic, but helpful things with
Ion Torrent NGS data in general.  Some of the tools, as described below are 
more general in nature, however, and hopefully useful little bits to do quick 
jobs.


Included Scripts
****************

For now, here is a brief description of the tools included in this repo.  Each
one has a full set of help docs, which can be accessed with by passing the 
``-h`` or ``--help`` option to the script.

getseq.pl
=========

    **Current Version:** v1.3.0_110515 

    **Requirements:**

        - Perl Modules: 

            * ``LWP::Simple``
            * ``XML::Twig``
            * ``Sort::Versions``
            * ``Data::Dump``

    **Description:** 

        Script to query the UCSC DAS server and pull out sequence information 
        given a position string.  Can use either a single string entry: ::

           <<<chrx:123435

        or can use a file with positions in the same format and get a batch 
        output.

vcfExtractor.pl
===============

    **Current Version:** v8.0.031618

    **Requirements:**

        - `VCF Tools <http://vcftools.sourceforge.net/>`_ 
        - Perl Modules: 
            * ``Sort::Versions``
            * ``Data::Dump``

    **Description:** 

        Script to parse Ion Torrent specific VCF files and pull out variant 
        data. This works with TS v4.2 and v5.0 files, both run with or without
        Ion Reporter systems. 

        In order to run this utility, you'll need to have the 
        package installed and `VCF Tools`_ in your ``$PATH``. There may be some 
        other non-standard Perl modules to be installed, such as 
        ``Sort::Versions``, ``Data::Dump``, etc. All can easily be installed 
        from `CPAN <https://www.cpan.org>`_ as usual.  

        See the help documentation for this script for details on the options
        and functionality of this tool: ::
        
            $ vcfExtractor.pl -h
            
readlength_histogram.pl
=======================

    **Current Version:** v7.25.031418

    **Requirements:**

        - `Statistics::R 
          <http://search.cpan.org/~fangly/Statistics-R/lib/Statistics/R.pm>`_ 
        - `ggplot2 <http://ggplot2.org>`_ 

    **Description:** 

        Read in an Ion Torrent BAM file and generate a readlength histogram plot 
        from the sample.  This script will require the Perl `Statistics::R`_
        module, as well as, the most excellent `ggplot2`_ library in the `R 
        Statistics` package.

map_refs.py
===========

    **Current Version:** v0.1.020918

    **Requirements:**

        - Konstantin's Python `pyliftover library 
          <https://github.com/konstantint/pyliftover>`_

    **Description:** 

        Map coordinates of two reference assemblies (e.g. hg18 and hg19) 
        together in order.  This utility requires Konstantin's excellent python 
        `pyliftover library`_  which leverages the UCSC liftOver utility for 
        mapping reference assemblies.

germline_merge.pl
=================

    **Current Version:** v0.4.030118

    **Requirements:**

        - ``vcfExtractor.pl``

    **Description:** 

        Combine OCA Ion Reporter blood and tumor VCFs to generate a tumor / 
        normal comparison file.  In reality, though the labels will be 'blood' 
        and 'tumor' related, the data really can be generated by comparing any 
        two VCF files from Ion Reporter. 

get_clinvar_variant_data.py
===========================

    **Current Version:** 2.0_111417

    **Requirements:**

        - Python 3
        - Python 3 `requests library 
          <http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/>`_

    **Description:** 

        Input a file, comma separated list, or a single ClinVar ID and get a 
        table of variant information derived from ClinVar using the eutils API 
        functionality of NCBI. No filtering possible for now, but will be added 
        later. 

get_pathway.py
==============

    **Current Version:** v1.1.021618

    **Requirements:**

    **Description:** 
    
        Using a pathway lookup table in ``resources``, generate get a list of 
        oncogenic related pathways for a gene or set of genes.  Need to continue
        to refine the pathways lookup tables, but the hope is that this will 
        be a good annotator tool that can be implemented into other pipelines.

protein_domain_retrieve.py
==========================

    **Current Version:** v0.2.121517

    **Requirements:**

    **Description:** 
       *This script is not yet complete and is still being worked on.*
